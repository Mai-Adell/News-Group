# News-Group

## Categorize each news item into its own group from 20 groups of news


It's our first natural language processing project, where we used many techniques like :
Text cleaning 
Text preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization)
Feature extraction (using TF-IDF)

then we using classifiers to classify each news item to it's right group.
we used many classifers as to get the one with the best acuracy :
- Naive Bayes
- SVM
- KNN
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression

Results :
• Naive Bayes : 0.8474
• SVM : 0.8476
• KNN : 0.8476
• Decision Tree : 0.8476
• Random Forest : 0.8476
• Logistic Regression : 0.8476
